# Frontend Service

This directory contains the user-facing dashboard for the sensor monitoring application. It's a single-page web application built with standard, framework-free web technologies.

## Technologies

- **HTML**: The structure and content of the page are defined in `index.html`.
- **CSS**: The application is styled with a modern, dark-themed design in `dashboard.css`.
- **JavaScript**: All client-side logic, including API calls and DOM manipulation, is handled in `dashboard.js`.

## How It Works

The dashboard provides a real-time view of the data being generated by the sensor and processed by the analytics service.

### Core Functionality

- **Live Updates**: The user can start and stop a polling mechanism that automatically fetches the latest data from the API Gateway every 5 seconds.
- **Manual Refresh**: A "Refresh" button allows the user to fetch data on demand.
- **Data Display**: The dashboard is divided into clear sections:
    - **Sensor Data**: Shows the most recent raw data from the C++ sensor service (ID, status, temperature, humidity, timestamp).
    - **Analytics**: Displays the statistics (min, max, average) and alerts generated by the Python analytics service.
    - **Status**: Shows the connection status to the backend and displays any errors that occur during data fetching.

### API Interaction

- The JavaScript code makes `fetch` requests to a single endpoint on the API Gateway: `http://localhost:8081/api/gateway/data`.
- It then parses the combined JSON response from the gateway and uses it to populate all the fields on the dashboard.
- The application includes error handling to gracefully manage situations where the backend is unavailable or returns an error.

## How to Run

The frontend is designed to be run as a Docker container, served by a simple web server.

### Building the Container

You can build the image using the Dockerfile provided in this directory:

```sh
# From the frontend directory
docker build -t frontend-dashboard .
```

The Dockerfile uses a lightweight `nginx` image to serve the static HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files.

### Running with Docker Compose

To start this service along with all others, navigate to the project root and run:

```sh
docker-compose up
```

The dashboard will be available at `http://localhost:8080` in your web browser.
